== GameServer Start ==

Code Blind -> GameServer: GameServer created through\na <i>Fleet</i> configuration
activate GameServer
GameServer -> Binary: Code Blind creates a Pod with the\nconfigured Game Server Container
activate Binary
activate SDK
Binary -> SDK: SDK.Health()
note right
  <i>Health()</i> is a continuous
  ping that occurs under
  the configured threshold.
end note
GameServer <-- SDK: Maintains Healthy status
Binary -> SDK: SDK.Ready()
note right
  Call <i>Ready()</i> when the
  Game Server can take player
  connections and is able to
  be allocated.
end note
GameServer <-- SDK: Update to <i>Ready</i> State

== Matchmaker requesting GameServer ==

Matchmaker -> K8sAPI: Create: <i>GameServerAllocation</i>
note left
  Allocation atomically provides
  a GameServer from a pool
  of existing GameServers
  (Usually a <i>Fleet</i>)
end note
K8sAPI -> Code Blind: Intercepts <i>GameServerAllocation</i>\nrequest
"Code Blind" -> GameServer: Finds a Ready <i>GameServer</i>,\nsets it to <i>Allocated</i> State
K8sAPI <-- Code Blind: returns <i>Allocated</i>\nGameServer record
Matchmaker <-- K8sAPI : <i>GameServerAllocation</i> is returned\nwith <i>GameServer</i> details\nincluding IP and port to connect to.
note left
If no <i>GameServer</i> can be
provided, <i>GameServerAllocation</i> is
returned with a Status
of <i>UnAllocated</i>
end note

== Players Finish Game ==

Binary -> GameServer: SDK.Shutdown()
note left
Once gameplay is complete, call
<i>Shutdown()</i> to delete the
<i>GameServer</i> resource and backing Pod.
end note
destroy Binary
destroy SDK
destroy GameServer
