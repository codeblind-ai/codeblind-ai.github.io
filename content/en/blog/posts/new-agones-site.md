Welcome to the new Code Blind website!

We've implemented a new website, to enable lots of new functionality that we're hoping to
take advantage of now and in the future:

- Ability to support multiple languages
- Able to write documentation for new features, but keep them hidden until they are released.
- Search!
- Pretty Pictures! 😊
- Easy access to older versions of the documentation

Big thanks [Agones](https://github.com/googleforgames/agones) for an inspirational site theme 🙌, to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) for being an static site generator, the [docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) team for the core documentation theme support 👍 and of course [github](https://github.com) for providing amazing [pages](https://pages.github.com/) support making it nearly effortless to launch the page 🚀.
