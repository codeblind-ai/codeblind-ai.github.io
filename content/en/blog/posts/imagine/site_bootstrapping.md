  Hosting static SPAs on Github Pages is a great way to get started with a new project.
---

The CodeBlind site consists of two main parts:
1. Hugo based static site and documentation
2. Vue 3 based single page application (SPA)

The Hugo part of the site needs to be static, and supports the documentation and blog posts. 

The Vue 3 SPA is used for the main site application, which provides secure login using Auth0.

## Why Github Pages?
Let's start with facts, startups have no money until there is funding. Before then, we need to setup a site that is free to host and easy to maintain. Github Pages is a great way to host static sites for free. It also supports custom domains, which is a must for a professional site.

## Getting a domain
I have a domain that I have been using for a while, so I will use that. If you don't have a domain, you can get one from a domain registrar like [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/).
